# What is this?
This **MY PERSONAL** notes taken along reading Steve's excellent book.

The book, though, is by no means exhaustive, so I'm trying to add some explanatory notes to some places.

You may find the notes useful if you are, like me, working on Windows system, instead of &ast;nix distributions such as Ubuntu, Arch Linux, CentOS, etc. This is **important** since the book assumes so and therefore provides **NO**, if any, information on how to implement the same effect on non-&ast;nix system.
